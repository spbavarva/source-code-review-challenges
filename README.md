This repository is for understanding code review challenges and practicing source code review for different vulnerabilities as well as different languages. 

Here you will find vulnerabilities which are already reported in the Hacker One bug crowd platform or already public (e.g. React2Shell). 
Links will be provided to validate each vulnerability in the public. 

I'm open for contribution.
